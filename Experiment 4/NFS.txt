**Servers:**

**File Sharing Servers:**

1. **NFS (Network File System)**  
   - These servers are used in LAN.
   
2. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**  
   - These servers are used in WAN & LAN.

3. **Samba Server**  
   - These servers are used in Linux & Windows heterogeneous networks.

**Note:**
1. NFS is used in LAN because the bandwidth for NFS is higher compared to FTP and Samba.
2. FTP is used in WAN because it requires very less bandwidth when compared to NFS.

**NFS (Network File System):**

**Configuration Steps:**

1. Copy all the shared files to a single location:  
   `/nfsshare`  
   Files: aa, bb, cc

2. Create new files inside the share directory:  
   Files: aa, bb, cc

3. **Packages:**
   - i) **nfs-utils**: to install or uninstall the nfs-utils package.
   - ii) **portmap**: (please do not uninstall portmap).

4. **Services:**
   - nfs  
   - portmap

5. **Daemons:**
   - nfsd  
   - quotad  
   - mountd

6. **Main Configuration File:**  
   `/etc/exports`

---

**Experiment:**

1. Make a directory named nfsshare with files aa, bb, cc:
   ```bash
   # mkdir /nfsshare
   # cd /nfsshare
   # touch aa bb cc
   # ls
   aa bb cc
   ```

2. Check if the nfs-utils package is installed or not:
   ```bash
   # rpm -q nfs-utils (Prints a message whether the package is installed or not)
   # rpm -q portmap
   ```

3. To reinstall the package, first remove it with the following commands:
   ```bash
   # services nfs stop
   # rpm -e nfs-utils
   # rm -rf /var/lib/nfs/xtab   (Remove)
   ```

4. If the package is not installed, there are two ways to install it:
   - **Install from FTP:**
     ```bash
     # ping the server
     # rpm -ivh ftp://192.168.0.250:/pub.RedHat/RPMS/nfs* --force --aid
     ```
   - **Install from CD:**
     ```bash
     # mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
     # cd /mnt
     # ls
     # cd Fedora
     # cd RPMS
     # rpm -ivh nfs-utils* --force --aid
     # rpm -ivh portmap* --force --aid
     ```

5. After installing the nfs-utils package, create the file as below:
   ```bash
   # vi /etc/exports
   /var/ftp/pub 192.168.0.0./24(ro,sync)
   /nfsshare 192.168.0.0./24(rw,sync)
   ```
   Note: In vi-editor, write this content: (/nfsshare server IP address and number of systems connected in the network).

6. After installing the services, enter the command to restart:
   ```bash
   # services nfs restart
   ```
   Note: Execute this command twice because the first time it will show "failed" and the second time it will show "ok".

7. Access to NFS share from the client:
   ```bash
   # mount -t nfs 10.10.12.114:/nfsshare /mnt
   ```
   Note: In the client machine, enter the server IP address.

---

**Notes:**
1. `# ping 192.168.0.3 -b` broadcasts the address in the network only.
2. `# ssh 192.168.0.8` connects the PC to another PC, just like a terminal connection in Windows.
3. In NFS, all files and directories are by default in read-only mode.

**Common KVM Switch:**
Using a KVM switch, a monitor, keyboard, and mouse can be connected to two computers.
